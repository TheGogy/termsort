# Termsort

This is a project based on the famous video by Timo Bingmann, https://youtu.be/kPRA0W1kECg.

To compile it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thegogy/termsort
cd termsort

make clean install
```

By default, this will install the project to your `$HOME/.local/bin` directory. This can be changed by instead running the following command:

```bash
make install INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/custom/install/dir
```
